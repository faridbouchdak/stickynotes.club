**About StickyNotes.club**
Welcome to StickyNotes.club, a simple and intuitive web-based sticky notes application. My mission is to provide a secure and reliable platform for you to jot down your thoughts, ideas, and reminders.

StickyNotes.club was initially inspired by Matthew's project [Subway Therapy](http://www.subwaytherapy.com/), but as the need for digital note-taking and mental wellness tools has grown, it has evolved into a platform for anyone looking to jot down their thoughts, ideas, and feelings in an online space.

StickyNotes.club is still a one man team dedicated to building a high-quality service that meets your needs. My Service is hosted on Cloudflare and a server, with backups, on Hetzner to ensure maximum security and uptime.

I am offering a free plan with limited features, as well as a paid plan with additional features. The paid plan is billed through Polar.sh and Stripe, and you can cancel at any time.

I am committed to protecting your personal data and complying with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The Privacy Policy sets out how I collect, use, and protect your personal data.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact me at hey@faridbouchdak.com. I am always here to help.
